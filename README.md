### Notes
This is done as a hackathon project for Svelte Hackathon. There are probably a bunch of bugs that I've missed while hacking at 2am in the morning. Development is fully done with Chrome. Compatibility with other browsers are not tested. API key is stored locally on the browser with local storage.
